# Challenge 4 - Secrets Manager (Bonus)

This one doesn't have any prewritten test cases attached to it because it's trickier to write tests for. Besides, this challenge is more useful to expose you to new ideas and try your hand at some
top tier production-level application security.

Infisical is an open-source secrets management solution designed to help manage secrets across environments and between developers.
While you may not decide to use it for your own projects, it'll give you an idea of the overall concept of how to use a secrets manager.

Your task: Figure out how to integrate Infisical to verify JWTs even more securely than using `.env` files.
