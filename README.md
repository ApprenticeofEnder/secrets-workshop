## The Challenges

This workshop is based on a series of challenges. To progress through, solve them (preferably) in order.
The challenges are based on `vitest` test suites -- surprise, you're getting experience with unit testing, too!

To run the challenges:

```bash
npm run challenge1 # for challenge 1
npm run challenge2 # for challenge 2
npm run challenge3 # for challenge 3
# No tests for challenge 4 . . . you'll see why!
```

There's no real incentive for completing these challenge quickly or slowly.
They're designed to get you familiar with working with secrets, so that'll be useful to put on a resume!
